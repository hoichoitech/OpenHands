/**
 * Warns the user on the home screen when the active agent has no usable LLM —
 * most notably after they skip onboarding, which persists no settings. Offers
 * a single action that routes to LLM settings so the failure is communicated
 * up front instead of surfacing only when a conversation attempt errors out.
 *
 * Renders nothing while settings load (avoids a flash) or once the LLM is
 * configured; the settings query refetches after a key is saved, so the banner
 * unmounts on its own.
